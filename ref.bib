  title = {Merge: a programming model for heterogeneous multi-core systems},
  journal = {ASPLOS},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {In this paper we propose the Merge framework, a general purpose programming
	model for heterogeneous multi-core systems. The Merge framework replaces
	current ad hoc approaches to parallel programming on heterogeneous
	platforms with a rigorous, library-based methodology that can automatically
	distribute computation across heterogeneous cores to achieve increased
	energy and performance efficiency. The Merge framework provides (1)
	a predicate dispatch-based library system for managing and invoking
	function variants for multiple architectures; (2) a high-level, library-oriented
	parallel language based on map-reduce; and (3) a compiler and runtime
	which implement the map-reduce language pattern by dynamically selecting
	the best available function implementations for a given input and
	machine configuration. Using a generic sequencer architecture interface
	for heterogeneous accelerators, the Merge framework can integrate
	function variants for specialized accelerators, offering the potential
	for to-the-metal performance for a wide range of heterogeneous architectures,
	all transparent to the user. The Merge framework has been prototyped
	on a heterogeneous platform consisting of an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU
	and an 8-core 32-thread Intel Graphics and Media Accelerator X3000,
	and a homogeneous 32-way Unisys SMP system with Intel Xeon processors.
	We implemented a set of benchmarks using the Merge framework and
	enhanced the library with X3000 specific implementations, achieving
	speedups of 3.6x -- 8.5x using the X3000 and 5.2x -- 22x using the
	32-way system relative to the straight C reference implementation
	on a single IA32 core.},

	and software developments that have led to the recent interest in
	this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate

	be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next
	generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey

	Nevertheless, implementing such runtimes for large-scale shared-memory

	Phoenix, a MapReduce runtime for shared-memory multi-cores and multiprocessors,
	on a quad-chip, 32-core, 256-thread UltraSPARC T2+ system with NUMA

	interactions leads to significant execution time reduction with 256
	threads (average of 2.5x, maximum of 19x). We also identify the roadblocks

	NUMA systems, which are inherently tied to the OS scalability for
